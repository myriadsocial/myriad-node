# Description

Please include a summary of the change in dot point form. Please also include relevant motivation for decisions you made and if there are any TODO items you could not complete. List any dependencies that you added (e.g. package.json).

For example:

- Filename.js: Added comment button to CommentComponent
  - I only enabled the button if the user has logged in (motivation)
  - I couldn't figure out a way to centre the button with flexbox (TODO)
- Filename2.js: bla bla bla
  - nocus dorem iptus locum
- package.json:
  - Added sharp version 2.1.0
    - Need this to compress images (motivation)
    - Tried compress-js but it's deprecated (more motivation)
